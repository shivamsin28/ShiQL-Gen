        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="mt-3">Hi there! We're Shiql Gen, a friendly little platform born in 2025 from a group of final-year students who really wanted to make SQL less of a headache. Ever spent hours debugging queries or juggling between tools? Yeah, us too. That’s why we built this—to help you work smarter, not harder.</p> 
        <p class="mt-3"><b>Here’s what we do to make your life easier:</b></p>
        <p class="mt-3"><b>Write Queries for You –</b> Describe what you need like you’re talking to a coworker, and we’ll turn it into clean, efficient SQL.</p> 
        <p class="mt-3"><b>No More Database Chaos –</b> Connect to your existing databases, spin up new ones, or import data—all in one place. No more tab overload!</p> 
        <p class="mt-3"><b>Tables That Build Themselves –</b> Need a table? Tell us what it should do, and we’ll design it for you. Less time wrestling with schemas, more time getting things done.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We believe working with databases should be:</p>

        <p> Simple – No more memorizing syntax or digging through documentation</p>
         
         <p>Efficient – Less time debugging, more time building</p>.
         
         <p>Accessible – Powerful tools that work for beginners and experts alike</p>
         <p>Shiql Gen is our answer – an AI assistant that handles the technical heavy lifting so you can focus on what matters. We're not just building another query tool; we're rethinking how people interact with databases entirely.
         
         Still a small team, still passionate, still eating too much pizza while we work on making Shiql Gen better every day. Come build with us.</p>
